# ADM-HW2-group-9
***
This repository contains the solution of the second homework.

A short description of the files in this repository:

1. `HW2_group_9.ipynb`: this file contains all the solutions except for the command line question. Firt you'll see solutions of RQ1-RQ8 then the bonus point, then again a check of the command line question and at the end the solutions of AQ1 and AQ2.

2. `import_data.sh`: a file that should be imported in the terminal in order to download all the datasets necessary to run HW2_group_9.ipynb.

3. `CommandLine.sh`: this files contains the solution of the command line question.

As suggested, this is the link of the notebook: https://nbviewer.org/github/AuroraBassani/ADM-HW2-group-9/blob/main/HW2_group_9.ipynb
